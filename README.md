# Mock Google Search Engine 

### Project Description
> The objective of this project was to build a mock up of the _Google Search Engine_, using our own API to produce search results when the search button is clicked, as well as produce randomised results when the 'Feeling Lucky' button is clicked.


#### Technologies
* CSS 
* HTML 
* JavaScript
* Bootstrap
* Node.js
* jQuery
* Express
* Trello

### Process
> To begin our project, we created a Kanban board on Trello to plan our project and to organise the tasks we needed to complete.
> We then had a look at the Google main page and decided on our design. After this, we began to implement our HTML to build the bones of our pages. This was later styled using CSS and Bootstrap. 

### Wins & Challenges

#### Wins
> We managed to get the server running and created a basic API.

#### Challenges
> Because the API was basic, we struggled to connect it to achieve the goals we were striving for so we had to use an external Google Search API.
> Displaying the search results in the way we desired as some information from the API was not displaying.
> 

#### Bugs
> Potential unneeded styling that has been overlooked.

### Future Features
> An API that works and randomises the search so that the 'Get Lucky' button works.
> Connecting to the Gmal service.
> More functionality with the buttons.
